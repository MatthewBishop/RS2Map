# RS2Map

This repository will show the incremental changes in the landscape/object map files used by jagex from revision 225 to 377.

Due to the syncing method used prior to revision 234, it is currently unable to be determined exactly how many maps are missing. 
Future work will be done with revision 194 to incorporate them.

The information is not complete due to data that is missing. Additionally, there is no commit for revision 363. The maps were identical to 362.

From revisions 274 through 377, the following areas are missing:
